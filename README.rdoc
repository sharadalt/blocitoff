The application Todo_list is the 1st project, I worked on.The application allows users to create self-destructing to-do 
lists.

To-do lists are lists of items you want to remember, but are not very important and thus get consistently put off. To address the problem of to-do list clutter, we create Todo_list.

Todo_list will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items have not been completed after seven days.
