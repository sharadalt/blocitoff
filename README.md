<h1>Todo_list</h1>

The application Todo_list, allows users to create self-destructing to-do lists.

To-do lists are lists of items you want to remember, but are not very important and thus 
get consistently put off. To address the problem of to-do list clutter, we create Todo_list.

Todo_list will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items 
that have not been completed after seven days.
