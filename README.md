== README

The application blocitoff is the 1st project, I am working on with my mentor Timothy Barnes.
The application which is going to be built allows users to create self-destructing to-do 
lists.

To-do lists are lists of items you want to remember, but are not very important and thus 
get consistently put off. To address the problem of to-do list clutter, we create Blocitoff.

Blocitoff will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items 
that have not been completed after seven days. 

To start the application you run it like any other rails application with the command, first start the rails server
 $ rails s and goto the localhost:3000, to make sure the app is running locally.
 
 For the use case, goto the link, https://sharadalt.github.io/portfolio/blokitoff
